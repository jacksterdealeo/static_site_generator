# My Start into Coding

[< Back Home](/)

Way back around 2012 or so, I discovered a game called Minetest. I played around with it in single-player for a while, but I didn't really care for it's basic gameplay. I kept checking up on it every once in a while, but it always seemed like it wasn't going anywhere. I eventually tried the multiplayer and discovered why people like it. The way mods let people make servers have just about anything they wanted was amazing. I joined a server that had added so much to the game that it was unrecognisable.

I discovered one mod in particular called [Technic](https://github.com/minetest-mods/technic). It is a mod that adds machines similar to the Minecraft mod Industrial Craft. After discovering that mod, I decided to try modding the game myself.

I didn't know anything about coding, outside of playing around with Python for a brief time. This game used a different scripting language called Lua. Instead of learning the basics of Lua, I used other mods as a reference on how to make my own. I made a mod that added ore blocks that gave more drops similar to RWTema's [Dense Ores](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dense-ores) mod. I added support for the Technic mod's ores and (for who knows what reason) added less dense ores that only gave the player items equivalent to half the normal ore drops.

I don't want to link my old mod because it was not made very well, and it is kind of ugly. Maybe one day I'll go back and fix it up.
