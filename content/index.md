Welcome to my website. This is where I write about some of my experiences in programming and gaming.

## My Guidelines for Making Useful Software

1. Make it easy to use for everyone.
2. Make it easy to maintain for anyone.
3. Make it easy to run anywhere.
4. License responsibly. Don't just slap MIT or Apache on something just because you can.

Sometimes these guidelines don't apply, but I aspire to allow anyone to use the tools I make.
